/**
 * Index des composants Creature
 *
 * Pattern Barrel Export :
 * - Centralise les exports des composants liés aux créatures
 * - Simplifie les imports dans le reste de l'application
 * - Facilite la maintenance et le refactoring
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import {
 *   CreatureContent,
 *   CreatureDetail,
 *   CreatureLoadingState,
 *   CreatureStats,
 *   CreatureActions
 * } from '@/components/creature'
 * ```
 */

export { default as CreatureHeader } from './creature-header'
